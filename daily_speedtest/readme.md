daily_speedtest  
===============
**Download Built App:** [**daily_speedtest.tar.gz**](https://github.com/cradlepoint/sdk-samples/releases/download/built_apps/daily_speedtest.tar.gz)

This SDK Application runs Ookla speedtests at configurable times (on the hour) each day.  

> Default hours are 8am, 12pm, 4pm.

You can edit the hours under System > SDK Data.  

Edit the "daily_speedtest" entry and set the value of "hours" accordingly.  

> It uses 24-hour format and just the hour number (integer).  For example 16 = 4pm.

The app puts the results in the **asset_id** field which is visible in the NCM devices grid.  

You can change the path (field) that the results go into in the same SDK Data entry.
